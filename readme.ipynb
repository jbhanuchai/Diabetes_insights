    "# Diabetes Insights – An Interactive Dashboard for Public Health Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "The Diabetes Insights dashboard visualizes patterns of diabetes prevalence across different demographic groups and health behaviors.Users can explore how factors such as age, gender, education level, BMI, smoking status, physical activity, and healthcare access impact diabetes risk. It is intended to serve healthcare professionals, researchers, policymakers, and general users interested in understanding diabetes trends and risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard is designed following the key information visualization principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clarity and simplicity\n",
    "- Interactive exploration\n",
    "- Detail on demand\n",
    "- Consistency and cognitive load reduction"
